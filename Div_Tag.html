<!--
In html there are majorly 2 types of html tags:
one is the inline tags and other one are the block tags.

The Block usually occupy the entire space inside the webpage ,by adding more block elements we are creating more horizontal blocks inside the webpage
but the inline tags are the opposite to this they take up exactly the same space that is actually required.

<p> is a Block element
<span> is a inline element
